## YoCoach V2 to V3

YoCoach V3’s software architecture is re-designed to handle and manage high user data, While taking care of quality code and system performance. Data independent code architecture is key to YoCoach V3 performance.

## Features
- **Teachers Availability:** We have two availability types: General Availability and Weekly Availability. Managing tutors availability for user specific timezone and conversion to convert system date according to user’s timezone was a challenging task for 70+ countries supporting DST(Daylight Saving Time). Completely redesigned the database structure, and have also added another table to maintain exact availability of the user(which Convert general to weekly availability) which inturn solved the time difference we face in countries with DST enabled.
- **Teacher & Group Class Search:** A major update on performance optimization to Teacher Search and Group Classes Search has been performed by optimizing database structure & queries and has created search models for teacher and class search by extending Yo!Coach base search model.  Redone complete Search form design to improve UX/UI.
- **Seamless Checkout:** Checkout is now on a single popup which is used for different order types. One step checkout has been used for booking Group class, Group Class package, Adding Money to Wallet and Purchasing Gift Cards.
- Inline & Unlimited Scheduling: Till YoCoach V2.4 We only had single session scheduling after booking. Now Learners can check Tutor’s exact availability and schedule unlimited sessions before booking a Tutor or making any payment.
- **Payment Gateways:** Redefined structure of payment gateways. Now Payment gateways are considered as separate entities which can be attached and detached as a plugin. Bank Transfer(Offline) added as a new payment gateway. We have an option to provide only required payment gateway to clients.
- **Meeting Tools:** Same as Payment Gateways we redeveloped Meeting Tools in V3. Any Meeting tool can be added/removed as per client’s requirements. Integrated meeting tools are Zoom Meetings, Lesson Space and AtomChat/CometChat.
- Fully Manageable Search Engines friendly URLs: URL rewriting allows URLs to be more easily remembered by the user. Option to replace the complete url path with any other desired url is possible now. Ability to add different custom URLs for different languages.
- **User Transactions:** Categorized user's Transactions for each type of order payment, Student Refund, Teacher Paid, Money Withdrawn, Money Deposit, Gift Card redeemed, Support credit and Support debit. Ability to calculate Total IN and OUT of a user’s money in the platform. We can have every type of report for every type of user.
- **Reports Sales & Settlements:** Database structure has been changed completely for the orders section and V3 has the ability to provide any type of reports. As of now we have Lessons Top Languages, Classes Top Languages, Teacher Performance, Lesson Stats,  Sales Report and  Settlements Report. Admin can check everyday’s Gross Sale, Discount, Net Sale, Paid to Teacher and Refunded to Students.
- **Group Classes:** Group Classes are now treated as separate entities, It may be a pre scheduled event by the Teacher and any Learner/Student can book and join it. Earlier it was mixed with one to one lesson/session and calculation of Teacher payment on success and refund to student was complex.
- **Manageable Themes:** Theme management is available with six basic colors Primary Color & Inverse Color,  Secondary Color & Inverse Color And Footer Color & Inverse Color.
- **Email Templates:** Updated all Email templates with new HTML structure. Email save and preview option available now which Admin can use to preview email templates. Header and Footer for all email templates are manageable at a single place.
